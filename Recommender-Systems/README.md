# ðŸŽ¬ Recommender Systems â€“ Kaggle Competition

## Overview

This project was developed for the **Recommender Systems module** during the MSc in Data Science at the University of Barcelona, structured around a **Kaggle competition**:

> **Competition:** [RecSysMasterFDS - 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rec-sys-master-fds-2025)  
> **Goal:** Build a **movie recommendation system** capable of generating personalized movie recommendations for users.

The project required designing, training, and evaluating recommender models using collaborative filtering approaches, evaluated by **Mean Average Precision @ 25 (MAP@25)**.

## Project Objectives

- Perform **data exploration and analysis** on user-movie interaction data.
- Preprocess and structure the dataset for collaborative filtering.
- Implement **matrix factorization techniques** for recommendations.
- Train and evaluate models using **MAP@25** on the Kaggle leaderboard.
- Experiment with hyperparameter tuning and different algorithms to optimize recommendation quality.

## Repository Structure

- `Recommenders_Kaggle.ipynb`: A complete notebook containing EDA, data preparation, model training, evaluation, and submission generation for the competition.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, surprise, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Tools:** Jupyter, Git

## Outcome

Successfully developed and evaluated a recommender system capable of generating personalized recommendations, gaining practical experience in **real-world recommender system workflows** under a competition setting.
