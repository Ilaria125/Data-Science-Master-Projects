# üìù Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects

## Overview

This folder contains **NLP projects developed during the MSc in Data Science at the University of Barcelona**, focusing on practical applications of Natural Language Processing for text classification and Named Entity Recognition.

## Project Objectives

- Apply **NLP preprocessing** and feature engineering to real datasets.
- Build and evaluate **classification models for duplicate question detection**.
- Implement **Named Entity Recognition (NER) using structured perceptron and BERT**.
- Gain hands-on experience with text similarity measures, embeddings, sequence labeling, and reproducibility workflows.

## Projects Included

- **Quora Question Pairs:**  
  Developed a pipeline to detect duplicate questions using NLP techniques including text cleaning, tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization, and training classification models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost) to identify semantic similarity between question pairs.

- **NER with Structured Perceptron and BERT:**  
  Implemented a Named Entity Recognition system using a structured perceptron with sequential feature engineering, alongside transformer-based models (BERT) to improve entity recognition accuracy and to compare performance between classical and deep learning approaches.

## Repository Structure

### Quora Question Pairs
- `train_models.ipynb`: Notebook for preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation on the Quora dataset.
- `reproduce_results.ipynb`: Notebook to reproduce results and generate final evaluation metrics.

### Named Entity Recognition
- `train_models.ipynb`: Notebook for feature engineering and model training (structured perceptron and BERT) on NER tasks.
- `reproduce_results.ipynb`: Notebook to reproduce results and generate evaluation metrics for the NER models.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, nltk, spaCy, transformers
- **Tools:** Jupyter, Git

## Outcome

Developed and evaluated practical NLP pipelines on real-world datasets, strengthening skills in preprocessing, feature extraction, model building, reproducibility, and evaluation for text-based machine learning and deep learning tasks.
