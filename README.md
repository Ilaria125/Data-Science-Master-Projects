# üéì Data Science Master Projects

This repository collects the **projects developed during my Master‚Äôs in Data Science at the University of Barcelona (2024/2025)**, showcasing skills applied across a variety of data science domains and practical challenges.

## üéØ Purpose

The goal of this repository is to **document and share projects completed during the master's program**, demonstrating applied skills and learning progress in:

- **Machine Learning**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Complex Network Analysis**
- **Deep Learning**
- **Recommender Systems**
- **Data Visualization**
- **Ethics in Data Science**
- **Agile Data Science**
- **Linear Algebra**
- **Optimization**
- **Business Analytics**
- **Bayesian Statistics**


These projects reflect both the theoretical and practical components of the program, with a focus on solving real-world problems using data-driven approaches.

## üöÄ Projects

This repository contains the following structured folders and projects:

- `Machine-Learning-Fake-vs-Real-Detection`: Kaggle-style classification project to detect LLM-generated vs human data across health and news domains.
- `Recommender-Systems-Kaggle`: Movie recommendation system developed for the RecSysMasterFDS Kaggle competition, focusing on collaborative filtering and MAP@25 optimization.
- `NLP-Projects`: Includes projects on Quora Question Pairs duplicate detection using NLP pipelines and a Named Entity Recognition system using structured perceptron and sequential feature engineering.
- `Meetup-Network-Analysis`: Community detection and analysis on Meetup networks using Louvain and semantic enrichment.
- `Visualization-Projects-With-Tableau`: Dashboard design, EDA, and data storytelling projects using Tableau, focusing on user-centered design and effective communication of insights.
- `Optimization-Projects`: Practical exercises covering numerical optimization, gradient and Newton methods, robust linear regression, constrained optimization (equality and inequality constraints), and stochastic gradient descent for SVM.
- `Master-Thesis-DS`: Clustering and task assignment optimization in a clinical Decision Support System (GNPT) using cognitive patient profiles.
- `Ethics-in-Data-Science`: Analysis of racial bias in medical risk scores using real data, exploring fairness metrics and the ethical implications of predictive healthcare models.
- `Deep-Learning-Projects`: Projects on neural network implementation, facial keypoints detection with CNNs, and uncertainty prediction using Monte Carlo Dropout on MNIST.
- `Numerical-Linear-Algebra-Projects`: Includes projects on direct methods for constrained optimization, SVD applications (LS, image compression, PCA), and PageRank algorithm implementations.
- `Business-Analytics-Dynamic-Pricing`: Dynamic pricing analysis and price prediction modeling, including exploration of pricing patterns over time and fairness implications in algorithmic pricing.
- `Agile-Data-Science-ML-Recommender`: Built a Machine Learning-based recommender system following Agile methodologies and MLOps best practices, including data dashboarding, pipelines for cleaning, training, evaluation, model registry, monitoring, and serving through a consumer app.
- `Bayesian-Inference`: Practical exercises using PyMC for posterior and predictive analysis.
