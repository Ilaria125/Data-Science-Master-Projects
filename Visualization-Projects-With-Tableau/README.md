# ðŸ“Š Data Visualization Projects with Tableau

## Overview

This folder contains **Data Visualization projects developed during the MSc in Data Science at the University of Barcelona**, focusing on effective data communication, dashboard design, and data storytelling using Tableau, supported by EDA in Python.

## Project Objectives

- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to extract key insights.
- Design and implement **interactive dashboards in Tableau** following best practices.
- Develop **data storytelling visualizations** with clear narrative and user-centered design.
- Apply **Gestalt principles and effective chart design** for clear communication.

## Projects Included

### Task 1 â€“ Dashboard Creation
Designed a two-screen dashboard (overview and detailed analysis) based on EDA, with audience analysis, clear chart selection, and implementation in Tableau.

**Files:**
- `Task1_Dashboard_Report.pdf`: PDF explaining the design choices, charts, and dashboard structure.
- `Task1_Dashboard_Tableau.twbx`: Tableau workbook containing the interactive dashboard.
- `Task1_Dashboard_EDA.ipynb`: Notebook with EDA performed before dashboard creation.

### Task 2 â€“ Data Storytelling
Extended the dashboard project into a narrative visualization using at least three chart types, with prototyping, user validation, and a final presentation.

**Files:**
- `Task2_Storytelling_Report.pdf`: Report detailing narrative design, chart decisions, and user validation steps.
- `Task2_Storytelling_Presentation.pdf`: Slide deck used for the final presentation.
- `Task2_Storytelling_EDA.ipynb`: Notebook with EDA and code supporting the storytelling visualization.

## Technologies Used

- **Tools:** Tableau, PowerPoint, Jupyter
- **Languages:** Python
- **Concepts:** Data Visualization, EDA, User-Centered Design, Storytelling, Gestalt Principles

## Outcome

Designed, implemented, and presented effective data visualizations using Tableau, demonstrating skills in dashboard design, storytelling, and clear, audience-centered data communication.
