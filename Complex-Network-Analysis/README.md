# üåê Complex Network Analysis ‚Äì Meetup Dublin

## Overview

This folder contains **Complex Network Analysis projects developed during the MSc in Data Science at the University of Barcelona**, focusing on macro- and micro-scale analysis, network modeling, and a final evaluation using the Dublin Meetup dataset with a conclusive presentation.

## Project Objectives

- Perform **macro- and micro-scale analysis** on complex networks.
- Build and analyze **network models** (random, small-world, scale-free) to compare with real-world networks.
- Apply advanced network analysis to a **real dataset (Dublin Meetup)** for final evaluation.
- Present findings with clear visualizations, semantic interpretation, and network insights.

## Tasks Included

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Macro and Micro Scale Analysis

Analyzed the global and local properties of real networks, including:
- Degree distributions.
- Clustering coefficients.
- Path lengths.
- Component structures.

Provided foundational insights into the structure and connectivity patterns within complex networks.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Network Models

Built and evaluated network models, including:
- Random networks.
- Small-world networks.
- Scale-free networks.

Compared these models with the real network to understand structural similarities, differences, and theoretical underpinnings of network structures.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Final Evaluation on Dublin Meetup Dataset

Constructed a co-participation network using the **Dublin Meetup 2018 dataset** to analyze real-world community structures. Key analyses performed:

- **Community detection** to identify thematically coherent communities within Dublin‚Äôs Meetup ecosystem.
- **Semantic enrichment using TF-IDF** on meetup names and descriptions to interpret community themes.
- **Comparison of Tech vs Non-Tech communities** to analyze thematic clustering within the network.
- Identification of the **top 10 bridge nodes** (using betweenness centrality) to highlight key connectors within the network.
- **Dynamic analysis** simulating node removals to test robustness and structural dependencies.
- Clear **insights on the strong community structure** and thematic consistency across detected communities.

This evaluation provided a comprehensive understanding of real-world network dynamics, community structures, and semantic coherence within large-scale social graphs.
