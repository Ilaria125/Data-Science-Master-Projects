# ðŸ§  Deep Learning Projects

## Overview

This folder contains **Deep Learning projects developed during the MSc in Data Science at the University of Barcelona**, focusing on practical implementation of neural networks for image recognition, facial keypoint detection, and uncertainty estimation.

## Project Objectives

- Build and train **neural networks from scratch** to understand backpropagation and optimization.
- Apply **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for computer vision tasks (facial keypoint detection).
- Use **Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation** in predictions.
- Gain hands-on experience with **TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch** in real-world deep learning scenarios.

## Projects Included

### Assignment 1 â€“ Neural Network from Scratch
Built and trained a feedforward neural network using custom backpropagation and automatic differentiation, understanding core deep learning concepts without relying on high-level libraries.

### Assignment 2 â€“ Facial Keypoints Detection
Used CNNs to detect 15 facial keypoints on 96x96 grayscale images. Applied data augmentation, adaptive learning rates, momentum scheduling, and dropout to improve accuracy and generalization, including specialized networks for eye and mouth keypoints.

### Assignment 3 â€“ Uncertainty Estimation with MC Dropout
Implemented Monte Carlo Dropout to estimate prediction uncertainty on the MNIST dataset using CNNs, running multiple stochastic forward passes to analyze predictive distributions and quantify model confidence.
